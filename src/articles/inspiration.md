description: Inspiration, what is it and where do you find it?

Like most creators of personal websites, I've left mine to linger, gathering digital cobwebs and age faster than a micro framework. I always put that down to plain old laziness but recently I've been thinking it might be something else.

For a long time I've found myself paralysed by the things I haven't done. My kindle is loaded up with books purchased but never read. Netflix is a catalogue of must see films that I haven't got around to watching. I have over two hundred games in my Steam catalogue and played less than a half of them but still I buy more in the sale because, well Demon Souls is Â£3 and it's a must play. All of these competing forms of entertainment jostle for my attention and I end up choosing none of them, instead finding sanctuary in mindless reddit browsing and Giant Bomb quick looks.

Yet as I lie in bed of a night I can't shake the feeling I've wasted opportunities, that I've spent my time poorly. The ever growing list of things undone towers over me, continuing to grow higher every day.

To that end this now exists, whatever this is. I'm writing this using my phone while on train traveling to Birmingham. It's dark outside, someone's listening to System of a Down way too loud and Netflix is blocked on the train's WiFi. Why is that important? It isn't. There's no good rhyme or reason why I should have decided to begin writing this all down but something compelled me to do it and now it does exist.

Let's see were this goes.
