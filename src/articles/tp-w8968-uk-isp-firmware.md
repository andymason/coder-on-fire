title: TP-W8968 UK ISP ADSL Router Firmware
date: 24 Jul 2013

After my old ASDL router bite the dust I picked up a TP-W8968 ADSL Wifi router.
Being a geek, the first thing I did was open the settings and start
configuring the options, one of these being the firmware upgrade. However,
what I didn't realise was the the UK version of the TP-W8968 router comes
flashed with a custom firmware which includes configurations for most the UK's
ISPs. Flashing the newer firmware downloaded from TP's website wiped these
handy configurations.

After a fruitless search I emailed TP directly and they
emailed the UK firmware that ships with the device. I'm hosting it here so
others who need it can get it.
